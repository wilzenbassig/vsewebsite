				<p>Happy holidays from Verdant Structural Engineers! It’s been a great year here at VSE and our team is now ten members strong. </p>
				<p>In 2019 we designed projects ranging from a 500 sq ft straw bale ADU to a 5 story hybrid structure made of wood, CMU, steel, and concrete.</p>
				<p>We’ve also just rolled out our new website updates (big thanks to Wilzen and Elli for this work!); check ‘em out <a href="http://verdantstructural.com">here</a>!</p>

						<p>Efficiently documenting the embodied carbon quantity trade-off that specific, daily, structural detail and material choices carry is a growing focus at VSE. Along these lines, Anthony had the pleasure of being a working group member for the development of the first low carbon concrete building code commissioned by the County of Marin, California and organized by the Embodied Carbon Network and the Ecological Building Network. VSE would like to thank all of those involved in that effort. Out of participation in this work came VSE’s revised concrete specification, aimed to capitalize on low-cost or no-cost adjustments to design and contracting teams’ approach to concrete mixes, which can result in significant embodied carbon emission reduction.</p>
